@article{Faaketal2013,
	abstract = {The temperature-sensitive exchange of Mg between plagioclase (Pl) and clinopyroxene (Cpx) has been studied experimentally, accounting for different anorthite-contents in plagioclase (XAn) and various silica activities (aSiO2) in the system. The partitioning of Mg between plagioclase and clinopyroxene was determined over a temperature range of 1100--1200$\,^{\circ}$C, using plagioclase single crystals of different compositions (XAn=0.5--0.8), surrounded by different clinopyroxene-bearing matrix powders to account for different silica activities from 0.55 to 1.0. The experimental design also allows the diffusivity (DMgPl) of Mg in plagioclase under these conditions to be determined. Both KMgPl/Cpx (defined as KMgPl/Cpx=CMgPl/CMgCpx) and DMgPl decrease with temperature and increase with aSiO2. Isothermal data for different XAn in plagioclase show a linear increase of lnKMgPl/Cpx with increasing XAn, but DMgPl appears to be insensitive to XAn. The partitioning data allow a new geothermometer to be calibrated, which may be widely applicable to terrestrial and extraterrestrial rocks where plagioclase and clinopyroxene coexist: T[K]=(-9219+2034XAn)/(lnKMgPl/Cpx-1.6-lnaSiO2). Application of this geothermometer to experimental data from this study reproduces the experimental temperatures within $\pm$20$\,^{\circ}$C. Diffusion of Mg in plagioclase is described by DMgPl[m2s-1]=1.25×10-4[m2s-1]·exp(-320,924[J mol-1]/(RT))·(aSiO2)2.6.},

	abstract = {Auto-encoder---a tricky three-layered neural network, known as auto-association before, constructs the ``building block'' of deep learning, which has been demonstrated to achieve good performance in various domains. In this paper, we try to investigate the dimensionality reduction ability of auto-encoder, and see if it has some kind of good property that might accumulate when being stacked and thus contribute to the success of deep learning. Based on the above idea, this paper starts from auto-encoder and focuses on its ability to reduce the dimensionality, trying to understand the difference between auto-encoder and state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods. Experiments are conducted both on the synthesized data for an intuitive understanding of the method, mainly on two and three-dimensional spaces for better visualization, and on some real datasets, including MNIST and Olivetti face datasets. The results show that auto-encoder can indeed learn something different from other methods. Besides, we preliminarily investigate the influence of the number of hidden layer nodes on the performance of auto-encoder and its possible relation with the intrinsic dimensionality of input data.},

@article{Liuetal2017,
	abstract = {Growing evidence for significant magmatic vesiculation prior to magma-water interaction (MWI) has brought into question the use of `diagnostic'features, such as low vesicularities and blocky morphologies, to identify hydromagmatic pyroclasts. We address this question by quantifying co-variations in particle size, shape and texture in both magmatic and hydromagmatic deposits from the Hverfjall Fires fissure eruption, Iceland. Overlapping vesicularity and bubble number density distributions measured in rapidly quenched magmatic and hydromagmatic pyroclasts indicate a shared initial history of bubble nucleation and growth, with substantial vesiculation prior to MWI. Hydromagmatic fragmentation occurred principally by brittle mechanisms, where the length scale and geometry of fracturing was controlled by the bubble population. This suggests that the elevated fragmentation efficiency of hydromagmatic deposits is driven, at least in part, by brittle disintegration of vesicular pyroclasts due to high thermal stress generated during rapid cooling. In this way, the shape and size distributions of hydromagmatic pyroclasts, both critical input parameters for ash dispersion models, are strongly influenced by the dynamics of vesiculation prior to MWI. This result underlines the need to analyse multiple grain-size fractions to characterise the balance between magmatic and hydromagmatic processes. During the Hverfjall Fires eruption, the external water supply was sufficient to maintain MWI throughout the eruption, with no evidence for progressive exhaustion of a water reservoir. We suggest that both the longevity and the spatial distribution of MWI were determined by the pre-existing regional hydrology and represent continuous interaction between a propagating dike and a strong groundwater flow system hosted within permeable basalt lavas.},

	abstract = {Glacial modulation of melting beneath Iceland provides a unique opportunity to better understand both the nature and length scale of mantle heterogeneity. At the end of the last glacial period, ∼13000 yr BP, eruption rates were ∼20--100 times greater than in glacial or late postglacial times and geophysical modeling posits that rapid melting of the large ice sheet covering Iceland caused a transient increase in mantle decompression melting rates. Here we present the first time-series of Sr--Nd--Hf--Pb isotopic data for a full glacial cycle from a spatially confined region of basaltic volcanism in northern Iceland. Basalts and picrites erupted during the early postglacial burst of volcanic activity are systematically offset to more depleted isotopic compositions than those of lavas erupted during glacial or recent (<7 kyr) times. These new isotopic data, coupled with major and trace element data, show that the mantle underneath northern Iceland is heterogeneous on small (<100 km) length scales. The temporal response of the isotopic compositions of the basalts to glacial unloading indicates that the isotopic composition of mantle heterogeneities can be linked to their melting behavior. The present geochemical data can be accounted for by a melting model in which a lithologically heterogeneous mantle source contains an enriched component more fusible than its companion depleted component.},

	abstract = { Large datasets are increasingly common and are often difficult to interpret. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance. Finding such new variables, the principal components, reduces to solving an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem, and the new variables are defined by the dataset at hand, not a priori, hence making PCA an adaptive data analysis technique. It is adaptive in another sense too, since variants of the technique have been developed that are tailored to various different data types and structures. This article will begin by introducing the basic ideas of PCA, discussing what it can and cannot do. It will then describe some variants of PCA and their application. },

	abstract = {In order to investigate the lateral dimensions and the shallow dispersion of the Iceland mantle plume we have measured the 3He/4He ratios in closely spaced primitive (Mg#: 59--70) basaltic subglacial pillow lavas erupted along the Northern Rift Zone (NRZ) of Iceland. This detailed sampling has revealed for the first time a clear gradient in 3He/4He ratios along the NRZ, increasing from 8.0 times atmospheric (R/Ra) in the northernmost samples to 20.4 R/Ra in central Iceland. In combination with previously published 3He/4He data, the new results from subglacial basaltic glasses from the neovolcanic rift zones of Iceland reveal a `plateau' of high values (3He/4He ∼20 R/Ra), which is approximately 100 km in diameter and located over the southeastern part of the island. The high 3He/4He plateau is well-defined and coincides with a regional gravity minimum and a seismic low velocity anomaly within the upper mantle beneath Iceland. We suggest that this zone of elevated 3He/4He ratios (>20 R/Ra) outlines the width of the Iceland plume conduit at depth. 3He/4He ratios are well correlated with Nb/Th and Nb/Rb, but not well correlated with other isotope ratios (as indicated by Pb isotopes). The correlations between helium isotopes, the geophysical variations, and some extremely incompatible elements, such as Rb and Th, and the lack of correlation between He and Pb isotopes, are most likely due to preferential concentration of He into volatile-rich incipient melts, and the subsequent lateral dispersion of the plume at shallower levels.},
